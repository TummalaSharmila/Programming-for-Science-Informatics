### **Programming Language:** 
Python

### **Python version:** 
Python 3.10.12

### **Description:** 
I am submitting a python script that allows to read DNA sequence from chr1_GL383518v1_alt file and retrieve the letters in the asked position of the sequence, get its Reverse complement sequence and retrieve letters as per the requirement, counting each base occurance in every 1000 nucleotide subsequence of the DNA and storing it in a nested Dictionary, access the dictionary and creating a list of count of bases in each sub sequence and adding them all. This python script helps to understand nested dictionaries and nested lists and how to access elements in them. I have changes all the letters into uppercase in the program to make it easy to count the bases.
